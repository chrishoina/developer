+ the data
    -- we capture all of the local museums here in the Las Vegas area
+ the api doc, or Here are some APIs our friendly Oracle Developers have built for you.
   -- this could be the swagger api for your endpoints
   -- here's an endpoint to get a list of the museums, including their geographic locations
   -- here is what that data looks like
Then a bief intro to the python libraries
 Flask allows us to
 Folium adds this shiznit...
Then dive into, ok now we can put the pieces together.
Instead of connecting to our database, we're just going to consume those apis.
Have the app start 'working' in pieces...until you get to the end.
At the end it'll include the OAuth2 stuff

and sprinkle it with 'did you know'
 If you want your museum data to come back sorted, add this query parameter to the API call. If you're dealing with thousands of museums vs a dozen, the database will sort if faster than your python code
