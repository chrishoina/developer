# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you will learn how a Python-based web application built atop the Flask framework can use prexisting Oracle RESTful Data Services (ORDS) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and catalogue data and and customer orders.

We will briefly discuss the environment for developing Python applications in Flask. We will introduce concepts related to popular Python libraries such as: 
- Flask 
- Folium 
- Json 
- Resuests

The main focus for this Workshop will be ORDS. We will explore key concepts related to APIs such as: 
- Modules
- Templates
- Handlers 
- Methods 

We will also briefly review the popular html and CSS framework Bootstrap, and a few JavaScript functions.
