# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop you'll explore a Python application built atop the Flask micro-framework. This application uses Oracle Database REST APIs <b>A</b>pplication <b>P</b>rogramming <b>I</b>nterfaces (APIs) to serve, display, and store product information as well as customer order.

Throughout this Workshop we'll explore key concepts related: 
- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) APIs and characteristics:
  - Templates
  - Handlers 
  - Methods 

- Python libraries: 
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) 
  - [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) 
  - [Json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) 
  - [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Bootstrap - a popular html and CSS framework Bootstrap
- Select JavaScript functions
- OpenAPI Specifications and the Swagger Editor

Estimated Workshop Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Explore an Oracle REST API-backed Flask application
* Explore and interact with Oracle REST APIs
* Explore Oracle REST APIs in a Swagger Editor session
* Review a Flask application's routes and interactions with Oracle REST APIs
* Review elements of a Flask application's presentation layer >

### Prerequisites

This Workshop assumes you have experience with Python development. This Workshop also assumes you have some experience with the Flask framework. This includes knowledge of the proper commands to execute a Flask application. 

While familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is helpful. Knowledge in these areas is not required as we will be reviewing them in limited scope. 

Finally, this lab assumes you have the following developer environment: 
- Python 3.10 or later 
- A text editor (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text)
- A Package Manager (i.e., Homebrew for Mac, or pip)
- Select Python packages: 
  - Requests 
  - Folium
  - Json
  - Flask 
  - Virtual Environment (venv) <i>or</i>the Live Server extension for VS Code 

:bulb: <i>If your development environment is not properly set-up, you may refer to the <b>Learn More</b> section for resources on how to help you set up your environment.</i>

#### You may now proceed to the next Lab.
