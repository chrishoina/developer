# Title of the Lab

## Introduction

In this lab we will explore the technologies and frameworks that comprise our sample web application.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) and developer tools 
This lab will discuss a variety of Enterpruise and open source technologies, including: 
- Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)
- Oracle Clould Infrastructure (OCI) <i>Always Free</i> Tier Tenancy
- Datbase Actions
<!-- I'm actually not sure about cURL, but I don't want to forget it -->
<!-- Make sure any changes here are also included in the Learn More section - we'll want to include those resources as well  -->
- cURL
- Python 3.10.x and later 
- Python packages (libraries) such as: 
  - Flask 
  - Folium 
  - Json
 - Requests 
- <i>select</i> JavaScript functions 
- Bootstrap HTML and CSS frameworks
- Microsoft Visual Studio Code 

We will discuss and explore these technologies and solutions in a practical sense. However, should you wish explore above what this workshop covers, we encourage you to refer to the "Learn More" section of this page. 

### Objectives

*List objectives for this lab using the format below*

In this lab, you will:
* Inspect the provided API
* Review the API's paths and functions
<!-- Should we inspect in DB Actions as well? What is more realistic? -->
<!-- Or should we import the module and go from there?  -->
### Prerequisites
<!-- At least for this lab, do we even need prerequisites? -->
*List the prerequisites for this lab using the format below. Fill in whatever knowledge, accounts, etc. is needed to complete the lab. Do NOT list each previous lab as a prerequisite.*

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account
* All previous labs successfully completed


*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## Task 1: Navigate to the ORDS generated API

(optional) Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

	![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

	> **Note:** Use this format for notes, hints, tips. Only use one "Note" at a time in a step.

2. Sub step 2

  ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png)

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: Concise Step Description

1. Sub step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```
